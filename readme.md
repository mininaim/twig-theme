## Note
We are currently using Bootstrap 5.3.x for this theme, since all themes are using the same framework, (including the merchant dashboard).
You can choose to use a different framework, such as Tailwind CSS, as the files are set up to use classes rather than inline styling or custom CSS, which should prevent any confusion.

This theme is a static HTML/CSS/JS implementation that can be easily (with some custimization, and tweaks) integrated with various ecommerce platforms, such as Shopify, WooCommerce, etc, but its dedicated to Zid ecommerce platform as a default theme.

We hope it helps you create a beautiful theme for your store.
